<h1 id="state">State</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>State allows us think declaratively about the design of the
UI.</p></li>
<li><p>The view is a function of the state. We declare these states and
implement their corresponding views. Once this is achieved, the next
step is to link the input to the corresponding state change.</p>
<p>An input changes the state, this change in state has a corresponding
view. All input changes are tracked by event handlers and these event
handlers are ties to state changes.</p>
<p>The state machine is formalized by</p>
<pre><code>F(Xi, Yi) = Yi+1 and the projection definition - H(Yi) =
Zi, where Zi is the ith view.</code></pre></li>
<li><p>This is achieved by the following steps.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Identify all the visual states of the component. This is done by
creating a mapping between the visual states and the and the different
states of the component.</p>
<pre><code>H(Yi) = Zi, where, Yi is the state and Zi is the
corresponding view</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Determine the events that trigger the state changes. These events
are either driven by users or by the computer like accessing a web
service etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Represent the state in memory with <code>useState</code>. The
function <code>F</code> sets the state based on the input and the
applicationâ€™s logic.</p></li>
<li><p>Structure the state to remove non-essentials and avoid bugs and
paradoxes.</p></li>
<li><p>Map the events identified in step <code>b</code> to state
changes.</p>
<pre><code>F(Xi, Yi) = Yi+1, where Xi is the input and Yi is the state</code></pre></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>How to structure the state</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Always merge the state when two or more state variables get updated.
For example if both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates are to
be updated at the same time, it is preferable to contain both
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> in a single state variable.<br />
</li>
<li>Ensure the state declaration does not allow for impossible states.
For example, when states <code>sending</code> and <code>sent</code> are
mutually exclusive, the state declaration should not allow for both the
states to be true.<br />
</li>
<li>Avoid and redundancy and duplication of state. Redundancy implies
the redundant state can be inferred from other states, while duplication
means same information is captured in multiple state variables.<br />
</li>
<li>Avoid deeply nested states. Keep the state structure flat or
normalized.</li>
